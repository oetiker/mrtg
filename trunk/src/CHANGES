* Fix russian translation bug #92

Changes 2.17.0, 2010-12-15
--------------------------
From: Steve Shipway s.shipway auckland.ac.nz
* added rrdcached support
  - new keyword:  RRDCached: which overrides anything set in the RRDCACHED_ADDRESS
    environment variable and sets MRTG to work in RRDCached mode.  This verifies
    that you're using a unix-domain socket and the socket is writeable.
  - Check for environment variable RRDCACHED_ADDRESS and use this if no
    explicit address was set in the cfg file, making the same config validity
    checks.
  - Make warning if using rrdcached to the effect that the thresholding
    checks will no longer work.
  - If in rrdcached-mode, and using RRDTool 1.4, then force use of update
    rather than updatev (as rrdcached does not yet support updatev) and
    consequently bypass the thresholding checks.
  - Changes to validity check error messages  to also report the file
    containing the error (as well as the line).

--------------------------
From: Stefan.Schnitter t-systems.com
* Free positioning of a generated ifIndex in the OID string using 
  the magic IndexPOS keyword
  
From: Tobi

* When doing threshold checking with rrdtool, there was a very expensive
  'getting the data back with rrdinfo and rrdfetch' cycle after each
  rrdupdate.  with rrdtool 1.2 and the updatev function this is not
  necessary anymore the new code speeds up mrtg cycle time by a factor of 3
  to 10 depending on your platform.

* Threshold Un-Borken Messages will only be generated when the value is 10%
  away from the threshold. Configurable via ThreshHyst

* New function thresholdmail lets you send an email when a threshold
  is broken. This feature talks directly to the mailserver and does
  not require any external programs.

* New template writers helper function in cfgmaker - oid_pick. It tests if a
  device is willing to supply information regarding a particular oid. This
  makes template writing much more pleasant. 
  http://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg-trac/browser/trunk/templates/cisco/host-cisco.tmpl

* added new tool mrtg-traffic-sum to build traffic stats based on the
  content of your mrtg log (not rrd) files.

* mrtg running with rrdtool can now do sub-minute resolution if the interval
  is specified like that: 0:30 ... note that you can not change the
  resolution of an existing rrd file. So this will only have the desired
  effect on new rrds. Also note that the graphing frontend may need changes too to be
  able to deal with the new interval type. Internally interval is now a float!

* new debug option 'prof' to see how long rrdtool spends on its writes ...

From: Daniel J McDonald dan.mcdonald austinenergy.com

 * get subif description on cisco hssi interfaces in cfgmaker

Changes 2.9.0
-------------

* The rrdtool integration allows for massively increased logging
  performance.

* Routers which change their interface numbers are no problem any more. 
  MRTG can now reliably address interfaces by IP, MAC, Description,
  Name and Type. The cfgmaker tool has been rewritten from scratch and
  allows to generate configurations with any of the above mentioned
  interface addressing methods.

* Indexmaker has be rewritten from scratch, it is now much more
  flexible and fully documented.

* All the MRTG documentation has been reviewed and ported to perls
  "Plain Old Documentation (POD)" format. This allows to provide all
  documentation in text, HTML and man format. It is now all available
  on the MRTG web-site.

* Config file parsing has been optimized. This makes reading
  configuration files much faster. Especially large configuration files
  are faster by factors

* Under UNIX, mrtg can fork into several instances while querying
  routers.  This improves data acquisition performance dramatically,
  especially with slow networks.

* Graphs and webpages can be generated on the fly is mrtg is used with
  rrdtool logging. Several tools in the mrtg contrib section are
  available for this purpose.

* And there is more: MRTG has been translated into 29 languages, OS
  detection has been automated, did I mention performance, many of the
  contributed tools have been dated and a slew of new ones has been
  added, The config file reading code is now available in a documented
  library which simplifies the creation of other tools which need
  access to the mrtg cfg file.

   total runtime (I am using fork 10) this went down from 43 to 21 seconds

----pre21------------

From: Lucas Nussbaum <lucas location ians.be>
 - contrib: ircstats2.pl a script used to monitor the user load on IRC networks.
   Contrary to ircstats by Matt Ramsey, it remains connected to the server.

From: Tobi
 - add mask to mkdir call it seems some perls can't deal with
   the simple form ... 
 - fixed forking code ... I think I got the typeglob magic right now.  note,
   when experimenting with the number of forked collectors, more is not
   always better. Eg, If you shoot two collectors at a single router in
   parallel this may prove to be slower than having one collector at work. 
   As a rule of thumb you might want to try a fork equivalent to the number
   of routers you are monitoring ... (my record with forking, RunAsDaemon
   and RRDtool is 800 interfaces in 13 seconds ... 
 - added the Include: keyword to the config parser as discussed on the ML

----pre20------------
From: Matthew Schumacher <schu location schu.net>
 - upate to cpu info
From: Tobi
 - fixed start time for newly created rrds ... this must be $time-2 not $now
 - fixed quick check rules for maxbytes1 and maxbytes2
 - missing directory[xxx] entries will get autocreated
 - modified quickcheck rules ... instead of strings we use anonymous subs
   now ... this has the advantage of perl actually compiling the stuff and
   thus finding errors in the checks even when they are not exercised ...
 - ***EXPERIMENTAL*** added forking function. If you run mrtg
   on a system that can fork (UNIX for example) you can try the
   new 'Forks:' option in the config file. The result of this is
   that mrtg will fork into several instances prior to
   going out to ask the routers for snmp data. For situations with
   high latency as well as mrtg.cfgs with many different devices
   this will speed things up considerably. It will not make things faster
   if you query a single switch sitting around next door.
   As fahr as I know NT can not fork so I have disabled this for NT.

   If you measure some performance data with this approach please let me
   know how much faster you went ...

----pre19------------

From: Roy-Magne Mo <romo location interpost.no>

 - added new interface reference type ifName introduced in mrtg and cfgmaker ifname references
   are introduced by the # character. Check the reference and the cfgmaker man pages
 - improved mrtg performance by not asking for uptime and sysname with every target when doing
   logformat rrdtool
 - fixed lost uptime and sys name querying for rateup logformat
 
From: Steven.Shipway location adsweu.com

----pre16------------
Thomas Abthorpe - Tby. * <tabthorpe location cgc.ca>
 - fixed broken header introduced in pre15 :-)
From: Rainer Bawidamann <Rainer.Bawidamann location informatik.uni-ulm.de>
 - reenabled threshold checking which got inadvertedly disabled
   in pre15
 - cosmetic fixes for MRTG_lib.pm
From: Tobi
 - we die always if we get errors from RRDs
 - moved read/write confcache functions into MRTG_lib

----pre15------------

From: Tobi
 - fixed problem with confcache where mrtg did not see that the confcache was
   already populated and thus repopulated it on every target ... this means that
   for all Descr / Ip and Eth targets we get a performance improvement of 1000%

 - fixed problem with calculation targets (adding results from two interfaces and such)
   this did not get detected properly ... 

 - integrated automatic log to rrd convertor ... if you have configured
   logformat: rrdtool and and are running for the first time,
   your old .log file will be converted to the new rrd format of rrdtool.
   the .log files will not get removed. So that you can compare the old with
   the new graphs. Note that this is a VERY NEW feature and it may well not
   yet work exactly as planned ... 

 - replaced the UseRRDtool cfg parameter with logformat: rrdtool. Check
   the doc/mrtg-rrd.txt file for details. (NOTE: 14all.cgi has not yet been
   modified to work with this new convention, but Rainer said he will do it in
   a few adays after his exames)

 - added -w switch to mrtg, cfgmaker and indexmaker ... found&fixed 
   many little problems in the process

 - fixed problem with missing space in per and posttargers

 - Rearanged directory layout to follow more traditional
   lines. Binaries are in bin/ libraries in lib/mrtg2

 - adepted Makfile to also install in these directories

   of non ifnum targets

 - modified parsing rules for EXEC targets, COMMUNITY
   and DESCRIPTION ... 
   EXEC backticks can be used inside when escaped like this: \`
   COMMUNITY space and @ can be used like this \ location  and "\ "
   DESCRIPTION space and : can be used with "\ " and "\:"
   in all other combinations the \ has no special significance

From: Tobi
 - converted all documentation to pod format and added several new
   chapters ...

 - created new mrtg homepage which links all available documentation online

 - created new installation guides for unix and nt

 - complete overhaul of the target parser (NOTE: it is NOT
   a horrible Hack any more ... look at the code (tobi is proud)

 - along with the target parser I also replaced all the snmpget logic.

 - calling Interfaces by ifNumber, Ethernet Address, IP Number
   or Description are all neatly integrated in the code. No more
   Horrible Hacks. Along with data polling, the Interface nubmers
   get double checked. If a reconfiguration occures, mrtg automatically
   gets the new configuration from the router. 

 - MRTG does *NOT* notice config changes on Interface Numbers anymore.
   This means if you have devices which change interface numbering
   do not call the interfaces into the mrtg.cfg by number but rather
   by Description or by Ip.

 - added new debug facility to mrtg. Different debug levels can now be called
   by name. Check the beginning of the script.

 - when using rrdtool, mrtg now also deals with *UNKNOWN* and non integer
   values.

 - extracted some functionality of mrtg into an external module called
   MRTG_lib.pm. This module is now used by cfgmaker and indexmaker. For
   indexmaker this means that it uses the same cfg parsing engine as mrtg
   proper.

 - over all about 30% of mrtg got replaced by brand new and rather clean
   code.   

 - complete rewrite of cfgmaker ... try cfgmaker --help for instructions
   cfgmaker can now produce config files with interface identification by
   Number, Ip, Description and Ethernet Address

 - complete rewrite of indexmaker ... the old code was broken beyond reason.
   options are different in the new indexmaker. Use indexmaker --help for help.

 - added RRDs detection to configure script (--with-RRDs can be used to
   set a path explicitly

   improvements for perminute perhour
   some OIDs for SQUID 2.0.RELEASE

From: Matija Grabnar <Matija.Grabnar location arnes.si>
   I implemented a patch that displays the per-hour rate instead of the per-second
   rate. It is triggered by including "hourly" in the options line.
   The patch has worked satisfactorily on our site (used when measuring cache 
   access and news server article counts)

   I find it better than simply multiplying the sample values, because it takes
   into account the actual time that passed between the samples.

   Error message if the cfg file can not be opened ... 

>From Simon Leinen <simon location limmat.switch.ch> better configurability of
SNMP timeouts ... 

>From Jean-Luc RICHIER (Jean-Luc.Richier location Imag.Fr  richier location imag.fr)
1/ If there is a ' in an external target description (within `),
   mrtg dies with eval problems.  (I needed ' to protect spaces).
   This comes from a substitution in the target, which tries to convert
   the target in a perl string, quoted with '. Therefore a ' in the target 
   causes a badly quoted string.
2/ The second problem is a lock problem : if mrtg fails (for example due to 
   the ' problem above), the two lock files CFG_l et CFG_l_$$ are kept,
   which forbid to restart mrtg.
   I think that at least the lock file CFG_l_$$ should always be destroyed.
   If this is done, the second lock will only have 1 link, so it is
   discarded.

* its suppress and not suppress. Changed this and added backward compatibility.

* From: Niels <niels location holding.pi.net>: added Option[] Integer which
  suppresses the  decimal part the summary line below the graphs ...

* added --vendor switch to cfgmaker. This enables and disables the 
  vendor specific queries ...

* added contrib from Carlos Canau <canau location dawn.EUnet.pt>
  It allows one to make a graph of analog/ISDN lines on a 
  Livingston Portmaster 3.   (PMLines)

* fixed a longstanding bug where rateup was skewing at log entries not
  aligned with the normal sampling interval. This happened when ever
  the NEXT macro was going from one sampling interval onto another one
  ... thanks to  Lane Patterson of GlobalCenter ISI <lane location isi.net>,
  Erwin Authried <eauth location softsys.co.at> and Ari Lewitter <ajl location NewsAlert.com>

* further improved the accuracy for large installations. Mrtg does now
  get a timestamp down with every reading taken from a router. If 
  we are running a simple target, this timestamp is passed along to
  rateup with the t option

* ircstats contrib by Matt Ramsey added ...

* fixed 'current time' passing from mrtg to rateup ...

* much improved handling of 'first run'

* output for cfgmaker is now sorted alphabeticaly .. (Andres Kroonmaa)

Changes 2.3

Added IconDir configurable, for people who want to keep the mrtg 
logo in a central location. As suggested by James FitzGibbon <james location nexis.net>

Made the period var a double in rateup.c as suggested by Dave

Added patch from Paul <root location nevertheless.redline.ru> to cfgmaker
now it will try to figure the speed of an interface ....

Stooped mrtg from aborting on non existing HOST names

Warn on Duplicate CFG entries.

Customizable week number thingy from Simon Leinen

included. From: Ulf Zimmermann <ulf location Alameda.net>

Fix for time chitter by Dave ...

relaxed parsing of keywords. ther can be a space before the 
colon .... as sugested by Samath


>From mcm location unx.sas.com Tue Jun  3 07:43:38 1997

Cheanged rateup.c so that it will start scaling the graphs when the 
datarate is higher than MaxBytes, if the AbsMax value is set. Even when it
is operation in unscaled mode ...
I also changed 'indexmaker' to allow me to pass in a title, and
to support the 'Directory' option in the configuration file.

From: Jay Soffian <jay location lw.net> Wed, 04 Jun 1997 15:34:01 -0400

Added new configurables XScale[], YScale[] to really enlarge the graphs and not
just make their pixels larger ...

Added configurable Step[] to allow for shorter base periods different from 
5 Minutes ... But beware, this is NOT supported ... and its likely
that you will run into problems ...

Updated to latest version of SNMP_Session.pm This will work fine with 
perl5.002 and above. BUT not with perl 5.001 !!! so if you are still using 
an old version of perl, use SNMP_Session.pm-for-perl5.001


2.2

Added Contribution from Anthony Rumble. For gathering stats for apache
webservers and squid proxies

From: T. Pospisek <tpo location spin.ch>
SHELL scripts to get active tty(-dial-in modem-) lines localy and remotely. 
I'm using them with a cyclades board but they can be adapted at wish to
different tasks.

made graphs in indexmaker generated pages clickable ... leewm location sgp.hp.com 

added contributet script for gatherig portmaster stats

Added 100BaseVG iftyp to cfgmaker

Fixed rounding Bug in rateup.c which caused it to scale graphs with small 
values incorrectly ...

Added rdlog2 by Phillip Simonet. This tool transforms a xfig network 
map into a clickable gif with colorcoded representation of the 
current load of your network links. The information for the colorcoding
is taken from the mrtg log files.

From: "Peter W. Osel" <pwo location hl.siemens.de>
A perl script to get roundtrip delays to hosts by sending a ping 
to them. Added to contrib.

Allowed any character except @ and \s to be used in a community string ...

Fixed two instances where variables were declared twice (my($var)) 
within the same scope. Late perl5.003 versions do not like that ...
and it was wrong anyway. This happens both in SNMP_Session.pm 
and mrtg

When using the Directory option in connection with [^] a stray space gets
added to the path. This is now removed with s/\s//g ... spaces in path names
are stupid anyway.

2.0.1
-----
Fixed ascendget script
