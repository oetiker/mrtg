CFGMAKER which instead of just returning an incrimenting port number on the

multi mode fiber fast ethernet

This version also grabs and shows all non-VLAN1 VLANS in a different color,

ports are in the VLAN, then adding those ports together. This means of
course that a port will be "hit" however many times it is in a VLAN.
