# mrtgindex.cgi v 1.1
# (c) 1997, Mick Ghazey mick@lowdown.com
# Thanks to Dave Rand, Peter W. Osel and Tobias Oetiker.

# Why CGI?
# Mrtgindx.cgi has features that only CGI can provide. 

# Runtime index:
# The index page is built every time the page is requested.
# Changes to config files are visible on the next update.

# Clickable graphs:
# Each graph is a clickable hyperlink to more information.

# Automatic updates:
# The index page automatically updates every 5 minutes.
# Modify $interval to adjust this period.

# Timely updates:
# Mrtgindx.cgi predicts when to update based on when the
# current graphs were completed.
# Updates occurs shortly after the graphs are completed
# regardless of when the page was initially requested.
# Modify $guardband to adjust this period.
# If the guardband is too small you run the risk of attempting
# an update while a graph is under construction. 

# Predictable graph order:
# Graphs appear in the same order as Titles in the config files.
# If there are multiple config files graphs from the first config
# file appear before those from the second, etc.

# Customizable graph order:
# If you want your index ordered differently than your
# config files you can use a dummy config file. Mrtgindex.cgi is
# only interested in "Title" statements. You could, for example,
# have different dummy config files for different arangements
# of graphs.

# Web based graph order selection:
# Click Top, Up, Down, or Bot to change the position of a graph.

# Multiple config files:
# Mrtgindex.cgi supports multiple config files. Some users
# run mrtg with more than one config file. The reason may be
# because certain events are run on a different schedules, 
# 5 and 10 minute intervals for example.
# Or perhaps multiple instances of mrtg are run
# to assure completion within a 5 minute interval.
# Ping-probes have longer run times than measuring traffic
# on local routers, for example. However, CPU load is similar.
# Modify the @config_files array below to suit your environment.

# Runs fast:
# Mrtgindx.cgi is fast because it doesn't create graph files or
# maintain log files. In addition, web based graph order changes
# benefit from browser cacheing of graphs.

# Index.cgi:
# You might want to rename this file "index.cgi". Then it
# will load automatically when when the directory is browsed -
# much as index.html loads automatically. You might have to
# modify "DirectoryIndex" in srm.conf if you're using Apache
# to allow CGI programs to be index files.

# CGI.pm required:
# Mrtgindex.cgi requires CGI.pm by Lincoln Stein
# http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/ftp/pub/software/WWW/cgi_docs.html
